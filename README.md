## Overview
 #### The Drug Recommendation System uses machine learning algorithms to recommend the most suitable drugs based on symptoms, disease categories, or a combination of factors. The backend is powered by Django, and machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines are used to predict the drug recommendations.

#### This system is useful for healthcare professionals, pharmacists, and anyone looking for suggestions on appropriate medication based on a set of symptoms.

 ## Technologies Used
 
 * Backend: Django
* Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
* Database: SQLite (or any other relational database supported by Django)
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Django Templates)
* Deployment: Heroku, AWS, or any other server (Optional)
* Version Control: GitHub

  
## Features
 * User-friendly web interface.
* Input forms to submit symptoms or disease information.
* ML model to predict and recommend drugs based on inputs.
* A database of drugs and their characteristics.
* Option to view detailed information about the recommended drugs.
* Option for users to rate or provide feedback on recommendations.

### python manage.py runserver
### http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.

## Usage
 1.Go to the home page, where you can input symptoms or disease categories.
2. The machine learning model will process the input and recommend the most appropriate drugs.
3. You can view detailed information about each drug suggested.
4.You may also provide feedback or rate the recommended drugs.
